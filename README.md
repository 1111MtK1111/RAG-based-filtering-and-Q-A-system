# RAG-based-filtering-and-Q-A-system

Project Objective:
Development of an AI-Powered Q&A System Based on Web Traffic Logs

In this project, I developed a Q&A system using web traffic logs generated for a website. This system takes natural language questions from users, analyzes the relevant log data, and generates the most suitable answers based on that data. The system is primarily built on the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model.

Due to the presence of numerical data in the log records (such as IP addresses and timestamps), only the request column has been vectorized. Additionally, to improve the efficiency of the system, a supplementary filtering process has been incorporated.

Technologies used in this project:

-Large Language Models (LLM)

-Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

-Vector similarity search and querying with FAISS

-Data creation, cleaning, and preprocessing


Note: The file named Web_Traffic_Log_File.ipynb contains the necessary code to generate the sample web traffic log file. The file named Q&A_system_based_on_RAG_github.ipynb is the main file that contains the project's code.
